Analyte,Reference Range,Interpretation
HbA1c,"Normal: <5.7% | Prediabetes: 5.7%–6.4% | Diabetes: ≥6.5%","Reflects average blood glucose over 2–3 months. Higher values suggest chronic hyperglycemia and increased diabetes risk."
CRP,"Normal: <1 mg/L | Low-grade inflammation: 1–3 mg/L | High: >3 mg/L","CRP rises with age. Elevated levels indicate inflammation, infection, or cardiovascular risk."
PSA,"Age 40–49: <2.5 ng/mL | 50–59: <3.5 ng/mL | 60–69: <4.5 ng/mL | 70–79: <6.5 ng/mL","PSA increases with age. Elevated values may suggest prostate enlargement, inflammation, or cancer."
Ferritin,"Infants: 25–200 ng/mL | Children: 7–140 ng/mL | Adult Men: 30–400 ng/mL | Adult Women: 15–150 ng/mL","Low levels indicate iron deficiency or anemia. High levels may reflect inflammation, iron overload, or liver disease."
Troponin I,"Normal: <0.04 ng/mL","Highly specific cardiac biomarker. Elevated levels are indicative of myocardial injury or infarction."
Vit-D,"Deficiency: <20 ng/mL | Insufficiency: 20–30 ng/mL | Optimal: 30–100 ng/mL | Toxic: >100 ng/mL","Regulates calcium metabolism and bone health. Elderly more prone to deficiency due to reduced synthesis and absorption."
